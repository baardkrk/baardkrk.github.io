# Website

I made this to share small and large projects with friends and family. For now, it is just a dummy-website testing the functionality. Stay tuned!

## TODO
- [ ] Make navigation bar disappear when scrolling down
- [ ] Make navigation bar reappear when you scroll up
- [x] Scrollable code and math functions on small screens

## Known issues
- [ ] When in "Mobile-mode" the navigation bar disappears if you click the expand icon, and goes fixed to the top of the page.
